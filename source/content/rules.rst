Basic Rules: Dos and Don'ts
===========================

The `NECSTLab`_ can be a great place where to work, study, make friends while doing the previous things but more than all the others, it represents a great opportunity to live a terrific research experience.

This comes at a cost. You always have to:

    * respect the place,
    * respect the people.

If you do not like something, or you think that something is not fair, please do not keep it for you, or do not try to change it by yourself, but say it out loud.

If you are not sure if you'd be allowed to do something, 9 out of 10 cases you are not. Therefore, before doing it, please, contact the :ref:`radrl`.

We want the `NECSTLab`_ to be a great place and we need help to improve it. Therefore, if you have an idea, contact :ref:`radrl`.

* Study in the lab with other folks:

    * all your colleagues have to be allowed to access the `NECSTLab`_,

    * Access to the `NECSTLab`_ will not be granted just for studying reason. While working in the lab for your class projects, thesis works, you can also spent some times studying without having to move to other places.

* Use the lab's facilities (see :ref:`facilities`) such as connectivity, computing horse power, software licenses, printers, etc.) to complete your work (the one you got the access to the `NECSTLab`_ for).
