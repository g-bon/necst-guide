Preface
=======

The purpose of this guide is to collect and consolidate the relevant information on how the `NECSTLab`_ works.

This guide is by no means complete and should not substitute common sense and human-to-human communication. In other words, if something is not covered in this guide, simply talk to someone. Most likely, you will find an answer among your `NECSTLab`_ colleagues. If not, ask one of the :ref:`tutors`, or the :ref:`radrl`.

Intended Audience
-----------------

You should read this guide before starting a project at the `NECSTLab`_. Most likely, you are a student, a visiting scholar, a professor, or just a curious guy.
