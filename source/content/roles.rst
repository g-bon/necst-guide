Students
^^^^^^^^

There are two kinds of students: undergraduate students, or "undergrads", and graduate students (Master Students or PhD Students).

Undergraduate Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Undergraduate students in the NECSTLab usually work on course projects or on their bachelor thesis. You can recognize them because the are the youngest creatures. They usually spend 6 to 8 months in the lab.

Master Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Master students in the NECSTLab work on their master thesis and at least one side project. Sometimes, master students collaborate with one or more undergrads within their thesis. You can recognize them because they believe they can rule the world. They usually spend 8 to 14 months in the lab.

PhD Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PhD students in the NECSTLab work on a 3 to 4-years research project and in plenty of side projects. PhD students collaborate with other PhD students and, normally, with one or more master students. You can recognize them because they spend most of their time in the lab. They are involved in teaching activities from time to time.
