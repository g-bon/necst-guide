Facilities and Services: What's in the Lab
==========================================

The `NECSTLab`_ offers several facilities such as computing equipment, resources and services such as web hosting for small projects, management platforms, and code repositories.

How to Obtain Access the Facilities and Services
------------------------------------------------

Ask your tutor (see :ref:`tutors`) or the :ref:`radrl` and be ready to provide thorough motivation for your request. For instance, *"can I use machine X disk space for my project?"* is usually not enough. Here, explaining *why* you need *that* machine disk space and *which* is your project is usually better, and sufficient.
